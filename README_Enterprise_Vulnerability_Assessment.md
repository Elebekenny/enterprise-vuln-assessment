# Enterprise Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus and Manual Exploitation

This project simulates a real-world vulnerability assessment and penetration testing engagement on a multi-host enterprise network. It leverages both automated tools (Nessus) and manual verification techniques (Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark) to uncover, exploit, and document high-risk vulnerabilities across Linux and Windows systems.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate a hybrid approach to vulnerability assessment using industry-standard tools and hands-on techniques, followed by exploitation and reporting aligned with CVSS and remediation standards.

---

## 🧱 Lab Setup

- **Environment**: Virtual network with 3 machines:
  - Ubuntu 20.04 Web Server (Apache, PHP)
  - Windows 10 Client (SMB enabled)
  - Metasploitable2 Linux Server (multiple services)
- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux with Nessus Essentials installed

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanning and plugin analysis
- **Nmap**: Port/service enumeration
- **Burp Suite**: Web app scanning and LFI/RFI testing
- **Metasploit Framework**: Exploitation and post-exploitation
- **Wireshark**: Network traffic analysis
- **CVSS Calculator**: Risk scoring and prioritization

---

## 🔍 Assessment Workflow

1. **Discovery & Scanning**
   - Used `nmap` for open ports and service enumeration
   - Launched full Nessus scan with authentication on 3 targets

2. **Analysis**
   - Analyzed Nessus scan results to identify:
     - Apache HTTPD vulnerability (CVE-2021-41773)
     - SMBv1 enabled on Win10
     - MySQL with default creds on Metasploitable2

3. **Manual Verification & Exploitation**
   - Used Metasploit to exploit Apache RCE and gain shell
   - Brute-forced SMB using `hydra` and accessed Win10 shares
   - Captured MySQL credentials and reused them across services

4. **Wireshark Forensics**
   - Captured TCP streams during attacks to analyze payload delivery and response

5. **Reporting**
   - Created detailed findings report with:
     - Exploit path
     - Screenshots
     - CVSS scores
     - Business impact
     - Remediation recommendations

## 📄 Deliverables

- `findings_report.md`: Vulnerabilities, screenshots, impact analysis
- `remediation_plan.md`: Patch strategies, hardening steps
- `screenshots/`: Shells, scan results, credential reuse proof
- `nessus_scans/`: Exported .nessus files and parsed HTML

## 🚨 Key Findings

| Vulnerability | CVE | Severity | Exploited With |
|---------------|-----|----------|----------------|
| Apache Path Traversal | CVE-2021-41773 | Critical | Metasploit |
| SMBv1 Enabled | N/A | High | Hydra + SMBClient |
| Default MySQL Creds | N/A | High | Manual SQL Auth |

---

## 📊 Value to Employers

This project replicates real client-facing security engagements and demonstrates:
- Hybrid scanning and manual exploit workflows
- Documentation and reporting aligned with industry standards
- Practical understanding of threat prioritization and remediation
